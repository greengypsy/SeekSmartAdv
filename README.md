Connected Places and Smart Wayfinding: Preliminary Studies on 'Port Explore'

What is the purpose of this study?

This research project is a field trial of a mobile phone application called Port Explore, which is in the preliminary stages of development. The application is designed to help visitors to Port Adelaide navigate around the area. The purpose of this field trial is to test the effectiveness of the application, and to gather feedback from users of the application.

How am I being invited to participate in this research?

You are being invited to provide information about how you use the Port Explore application. If you agree, the application will collect anonymous information about how you move around the Port Adelaide area while you are using the application today. This information may include location data, including how long you stay in a particular location (also known as ‘dwell time’). Your IP address and UUID may be collected and replaced with generic codes in order to protect your privacy. Your IP address and/or UUID will not be stored or shared. While you use Port Explore, the application may ask you to answer a brief, two-item questionnaire about your experience with this and other navigation applications. As this field trial only runs for one day, no information will be collected after 11:59 PM (ACDT) on January 16, 2017.

Your participation is voluntary, and you may choose to not participate.

How will this information be used?

The data that is collected today as you use the application will be managed to maintain and respect your privacy and ensure confidentiality. De-identified data about locations and dwell times may be shared with the Australian Smart Cities Consortium and the Port Adelaide Enfield City Council, and may also be published as part of a research article in an academic journal. After the research trial has been completed, an anonymous dataset of locations and dwell times will be available to researchers by making a request to Dr. Mary Griffiths. You will not be able to be identified through any of the information that is published or shared.

Who is conducting this study, and how is it being funded?

This research is being conducted by staff and students of the University of Adelaide. The researchers include Dr. Mary Griffiths, Dr. Nick Faulkner, Dr. Claudia Szabo, Dr. Aaron Humphrey, Ms Christina Kumar and Ms Kaitlyn Bayly. The study is being funded by the University of Adelaide’s Australian Smart Cities Consortium.

What if I change my mind?

Because the information is being collected in a way to ensure your anonymity, it is not possible to withdraw data that has already been collected. If you wish to turn off sharing your data, there is a setting in the application that will allow you to do so. Deleting the application from your mobile phone will also cease your participation in the research.
